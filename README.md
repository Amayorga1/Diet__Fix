#Final Project Review


# Project Experience 
Starting out choosing the project was difficult because I was not really sure how the project was actually going to be like. The majority of the project was learning
on the fly and being able to make everything work with trial and error. Since my project was more of an informational guide, I ended up spending too much time on 
the info and did not have enough time to design the project how I wanted to. The project ended up having most of the requirements but could have been better.

# Lessons Learned 

What did you do right?
I got the overall requirements to work, as well as most of the functionality. 

What did you do wrong?
I could not connect my database so I had to redo the project 3 times.
The project did not look as great as I wanted it to, and did not fully finish the project. 

Where were you lucky?
Throughout most of the project I got lucky with meeting the original requirements since they were all very simple and did not require
complex solutions. 

What would you change / what do you know now that you wish you knew "then"?
Make my project less of an informational guide, spend more time on learining HTML,Javascript,
and CSS to make the project look and have better functionality

Advice to future MSSA students:
Spend time learing front end technology and have a good concept on how your project should work and look before you commit to it.
